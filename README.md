## Introduction

Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for various operations such as finding unique elements in a collection, performing set operations like union, intersection, difference, and more. This repository aims to demonstrate how to work with sets in Python through practical examples.

## Concepts Covered

The Python files in this repository cover the following concepts related to sets:

- Creating empty sets
- Adding items to sets individually
- Adding multiple items to sets at the same time
- Python set methods such as `add`, `update`, `clear`, `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `symmetric_difference`, etc.

## Usage

To use the provided Python files, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-set-operations.git
